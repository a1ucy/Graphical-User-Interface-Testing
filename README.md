# Graphical-User-Interface-Testing
Purpose
This project provides an opportunity to apply concepts learned in the course and gain practical experience in GUI testing. The purpose of this project is to experiment with GUI testing tools.
Objectives
Learners will be able to:
● Develop test cases to validate GUI elements and page flows
● Perform automation testing using GUI testing tool’s features, coverage, test case reuse, test
results and usability.
Technology Requirements
● Any programming language
Project Description
Assume that you are working for a test organization for an IT company. Your test manager is asking you to research and experiment with a GUI automation tool that he/she might invest on and adopt in his organization based on your assessment and your experimentation.
In this project, you will complete the following tasks
1. YouwilldevelopasimpleapplicationwithaGUI.Youwillhavetwoversionsofthisapplication. 2. YouwillresearchandidentifyatoolfortestingtheGUIofyourapplication.

6. Directions
This project requires you to use graphical user interface (GUI) testing techniques and tools for a software which has a graphical user interface.
Task 1
Develop two (2) versions of an application with a GUI:
● Version 1
○ Select any application of your own or an open source which has a graphical user interface.
○ The application can be coded in any programming language.
○ The application should have at least three (3) GUI pages and there should be flow from one page to another.
○ Each page is required for have:
■ one or more images, buttons, labels, text boxes. Every page should have at
least one of all the GUI elements given.
■ any two of the following: a scrollbar, checkboxes, radio button, slider, list, drawing elements. You can select any two (2) of these elements to put on each page of your application.
● Version 2
○ You will need to have the same requirements as Version One but with a minimum of
three (3) changes in the GUI.
○ You need to make a minimum of three (3) changes in each of the three (3) pages in the new GUI.
○ Acceptable changes are changes in the size, location, orientation of the GUI elements. Note that a change in the text or wording in a GUI element is not acceptable.
One additional change:
● The flow between pages will be created in Version 1 on the application.
● In Version 2 you have to change the order of flows between pages. You need to change a
minimum of one (1) flow in the new GUI. Task 2
● Research and identify a tool for testing GUI of an application. The tool will be used to create test cases and for executing them.
2
Task 3
● Select any GUI test automation tool to record your test cases and report out the test results
● Create and record test cases for testing the version one of the GUI.
● Test cases should be developed to test the existence of a GUI element, correctness of its location, the size of the element, content of the GUI element and the correctness of the link (flow from page to another).
● There is no specification for a minimum or maximum number of test cases.
Task 4
● Execute the same set of test cases for the second version of the GUI.
● Report out how many of the test cases passed or failed when used for the second version of the GUI. Note that some test cases might fail and some might still pass during the execution of the test cases on the second version of the GUI.
Task 5
● It is important you make an assessment of how well the GUI automation tool has performed during your interaction with this tool in this project. Provide an detailed assessment of the tool in your own words in terms of:
○ set of features and functionalities provided
○ type of coverage
○ reuse of test cases
○ test results produced
○ ease of usage
○ type of GUI elements that can be tested
